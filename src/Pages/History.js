        <h1>History of Cryptography</h1>
        <p>
          Cryptography has a rich history dating back thousands of years,
          evolving alongside the need for secure communication and information
          protection. From ancient times to the modern era, cryptographic
          techniques have played a pivotal role in shaping military tactics,
          diplomatic relations, and technological advancements.

        <p>
          Explore the milestones of cryptography, from the early substitution
          ciphers of Caesar and Vigen√®re to the revolutionary advances in
          symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms like AES and RSA. Each
          era brings new challenges and innovations, reflecting the ongoing
          battle between code makers and code breakers.
