# theCODEBREAKERS

This web application was developed as a capstone project for the Number Theory and Cryptography course CN6136 / SEC407. Its goal is to provide users with an interactive platform to learn about historical ciphers, modern cryptography techniques, and tools for encrypting and decrypting messages.

## Features:

- Caesar cipher with customizable shifts.
- RSA encryption with key generation.
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange simulation.
- Vigen√®re cipher (repeating key and auto key modes).
- Educational resources on cryptography history and concepts.
